## Dictionary Express App

Hi, everyone this project is one of my starting projects when i was in collage, thought i can do some touch up and host it online, still works perfectly fine.  

* This Node app basically works with an api calls, two basically. The first one is `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/` to get the meaning of the word and the `https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/thesaurus?word=` to grab the synonyms and antonyms
* This app also consist of Handlebars to do some templating of conditional rendering (Learned in collage)

Basically, that's it for this quite little project i did, oh! here is the Link to the website: [Dictionary-app](https://dictionary-5luc.onrender.com)
